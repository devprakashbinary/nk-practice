            There's no relationship quite like the one between a father and a son. On Father’s Day, 
            let your superhero know how much he means to you with a Father's Day quote specifically about your 
            amazing bond. Whether you look up to the man that raised you, or you've become a father yourself and are 
            just now realizing the sacrifices he's made for you through the years, you'll be able to relate to these father-son quotes.

            So if you haven't written your Father's Day card yet, save a quote or two from this list. Sometimes it takes 
            people like James Baldwin, Michael Jordan, and even Brad Pitt to put into words how special the relationship between a father and a son really is. Make this June 21 one for the books with a thoughtful Father's Day gift, too!
